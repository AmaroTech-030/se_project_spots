### Overview

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

  **Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Html**

This project was done using HTML as the markup language.It's basically a profile website where users can create a profile and upload their pictures. For the startup of HTML i created a header, a profile section, a gallery section, and the footer.

**CSS**

CSS was the style sheet used for this project. As we all know we need that little bit of magic to make the page look good. With this property i was able to align everything together, seprate the elements as needed or stack them together. I was able to add some color and make the page look a little more live.
